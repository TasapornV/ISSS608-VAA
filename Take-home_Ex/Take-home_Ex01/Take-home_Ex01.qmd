# Task description

Age-sex pyramid is an analytical visualization commonly used by demographers to reveal the structure of population by gender and age group. In this take-home exercise, you are required to reveal the demographic structure of Singapore at planning area level by using age-sex pyramid method. Instead of plotting a single age-sex pyramid, however, you are required to display nine selected planning areas on a single view by using trellis display (also know as small-multiple plot).
