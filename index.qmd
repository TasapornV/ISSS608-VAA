Welcome to **ISSS608 Visual Analytics and Applications**. This blog is developed by ***Tasaporn Visawameteekul***. It is still a work in progress, where data visualizations will be uploaded weekly.

This blog contains my journey of creating data visualization beyond default, using R and Tableau. This is part of the ISSS608 course by SMU MITB program, by ***Prof Kam Tin Seong*** from Jan - Apr 2023.

If you have any feedback or need any clarification, you may contact me at [tasapornv.2021\@mitb.smu.edu.sg](mailto:tasapornv.2021@mitb.smu.edu.sg).

I hope you enjoy it!
