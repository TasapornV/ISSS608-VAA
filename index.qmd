Welcome to **ISSS608 Visual Analytics and Applications**. This blog is developed by ***Tasaporn Visawameteekul***. It is still a work in progress, where data visualizations will be uploaded weekly.

This blog contains my journey of creating data visualization beyond default, using R and Tableau. This is part of the ISSS608 course by SMU MITB program, by ***Prof Kam Tin Seong*** from Jan - Apr 2023. I hope you enjoy it!
