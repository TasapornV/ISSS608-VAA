    "text": "1. The task\nAge-sex pyramid is an analytical visualization commonly used by demographers to reveal the structure of population by gender and age group. In this take-home exercise, you are required to reveal the demographic structure of Singapore at planning area level by using age-sex pyramid method. Instead of plotting a single age-sex pyramid, however, you are required to display nine selected planning areas on a single view by using trellis display (also know as small-multiple plot).\n\n\n2. Data\n“Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022” is used to prepare the analytical visualization. It is available at Department of Statistics, Singapore(SingStat).\n\nMetadata\nPA = Planning Area\nSZ = Subzone\nAG = Age Group\nSex = Sex\nTOD = Type of Dwelling\nPop = Resident Count\nTime = Time / Period\nNote:\n\nFor June 2022, Planning Areas refer to areas demarcated in the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s Master Plan 2019.\nData from 2003 onwards exclude residents who have been away from Singapore for a continuous period of 12 months or longer as at the reference period.\nThe figures have been rounded to the nearest 10. 4) The data may not add up due to rounding.\n\nDate generated: 29/02/2022 Source: Singapore Department of Statistics\n\n\n\n3. Analysis\n\nWhat is the distribution of Singapore residence by Planning Area?\n\nThe above bar chart depicts the number of residents in each Planning Area. In this scenario, we choose the 9 most populous areas, which account for 52.3% of the overall population.\nNow, let’s examine the demographic specifics of these nine regions. What is the age and gender distribution of the population in each area? We will utilize the pyramid chart, which is separated into equal-height horizontal divisions. The width of each part varies. Population pyramids are produced using a horizontal column chart with positive and negative values. These graphs permit comparisons of distinct categories (in this case, age) across two series (male and female).\nIn addition, for comparative purposes, we introduce Trellis plot techniques, which consist of a grid of smaller plots. Each small plot represents a unique state or item, and all small plots have identical scales.\n\n\nWhat is the demographic breakdown of Singaporeans in the top 9 most populous Planning Areas?\n\n\n\nDesign 1 : 3x3 Trellis plot\n\n\nAt first glance, the shapes of all 9 selected areas are symmetrical. This reflects the proportional distribution of males and females. However, there are a variety of shapes. Bedok, Jurong West, and Hougang have a similar shape, with a symmetrical small apex that gradually widens and tapers to a smaller base. These 3 regions contain a substantial proportion of residents between the ages of 40-69. While Sengkang and Punggol have a form that widens in the 30-59-year age range, the population in the 20-29-year age group is much smaller.\nThis graph also reveals that the senior female population tends to be slightly more than the senior male population.\n\n\n\nDesign 2 : 1x9 Trellis plot\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Visualization Design Discussion\nFrom the Trellis plot above\n\nBedok, which is the most populous area has a big percentage of Senior generation (60 and above) compare to the other area\n\n\n\n5. Step-by-Step Description\n\n1. Prepare the data\nIn this project, we prepare the data using Tableau Prep Builder version 2022.4.0, which makes data preparation simple and intuitive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\nStep\n\n\n\n\n1.1\n\n\nOpen Tableau Prep Builder\nClick the blue button “Connect to Data”\nWe are using csv file, therefore pick “Text file”\nConnect our main data file “respopagesextod2022.csv”\nThe data field summary will be displayed as indicated in the image. We can see from this that our original data had 7 fields.\n\n\n\n1.2\n\n\nAdd a clean step by clicking the “+ symbol” and then selecting “Clean Step”\nTo eliminate Planning areas with no population, remove the zero value from the “Pop” parameter\nRename the step as “Filter Pop”\n\n\n\n1.3\n\n\nAdd a clean step “Group age range”\nTo make analysis easier, group the age range into 10 years\n\n\n\n1.4\n\n\nAdd a clean step “Create parameter”\nCreate the fields “Female Population” and “Male Population” using the following formula\n\nIF [Sex]=‘Females’ THEN [Pop] ELSE 0 END\nIF [SEX] = ‘Males’ THEN [Pop] ELSE 0 END\n\nRemove any unneeded fields, including Sex, SZ, TOD, and Time\nAt this point, you should get data with 5 fields 31K rows\n\n\n\n1.5\n\n\nExport the cleansed data to Tableau Desktop with a right-click and the “Preview in Tableau Desktop” option\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Prepare the visualization Design 1\nNow that we have import the cleansed data into Tableau Desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\nStep\n\n\n\n\n2.1\n\n\nWe begin by creating the “Total columns” parameter. In our scenario, we wish to generate 3x3 tables with a value of 3 for each column.\n\n\n\n2.2\n\n\nCreate the Calculated Field “Index”, “Column”, and “Row” with the following formula\nIndex = INT((INDEX())%[Total columns]^2+1\nColumn = INT(([Index]-1)%[Total columns])+1\nRow = INT(([Index]-[Column])/[Total columns])+1\n\n\n\n2.3\n\n\nDrag the “Column” Calculated Field into the Columns section. Drag the “Row” calculated field into the Rows section\nMake sure that the Column and Row are set as Discrete type\n\n\n\n2.4\n\n\nCreate the Trellis plot of 3x3 age-sex pyramid according to the Planning Area by setting the fields as depicted in the image.\n\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n\n2.7\n\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n\n2.10\n\n\n\n2.11\n\n\n\n2.12\n\n\n\n2.13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.

This indicates the ratio of males to females in the population. However, a closer examination reveals that the senior female population is typically slightly larger than the senior male population.\nWe may categorize them into 4 groups based on their similarities.\n\nThe first group comprises two areas, namely Bedok and Jurong West. They have a similar shape, with symmetrical small apex that gradually widens and tapers to a smaller base. These 2 regions contain a substantial proportion of residents between the ages of 40-69.\nWhile the next group Sengkang and Punggol have a form that widens in the 30-39 and 40-49 year age-range, the population in the 20-29-year age group is much smaller.\nThe following group includes 4 areas: Tampines, Woodlands, Hougang, and Choa Chu Kang. This group depicts a little head that rapidly enlarges between the ages of 60 - 69, narrows between the ages of 40-49, and then enlarges again before narrowing at the bottom.\nThe final one is Yishun, which has a unique shape compared to the others. In Yishun, the proportions of the people in the age groups 40-49, 50-59, and 60-69 are very similar, while the 30-39 age group is the greatest.\n\n\n\n\n4. Step-by-Step Description\n\n1.
