This data file consists of 199,999 rows of time-series cyber attack records by country.\n\n\nImporting the data\nFirst, you will use the code chunk below to import eventlog.csv file into R environment and called the data frame as attacks.\n\nattacks <- read_csv(\"data/eventlog.csv\")\n\n\n\nExamining the data structure\nIt is always a good practice to examine the imported data frame before further analysis is performed.\nFor example, kable() can be used to review the structure of the imported data frame.\n\nkable(head(attacks))\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp\nsource_country\ntz\n\n\n\n\n2015-03-12 15:59:16\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:00:48\nFR\nEurope/Paris\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:02:26\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:02:38\nUS\nAmerica/Chicago\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:03:22\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:03:45\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three columns, namely timestamp, source_country and tz.\n\ntimestamp field stores date-time values in POSIXct format.\nsource_country field stores the source of the attack.

In this step, we will write a function to perform the task.\n\nmake_hr_wkday <- function(ts, sc, tz) {\n  real_times <- ymd_hms(ts, \n                        tz = tz[1], \n                        quiet = TRUE)\n  dt <- data.table(source_country = sc,\n                   wkday = weekdays(real_times),\n                   hour = hour(real_times))\n  return(dt)\n  }\n\nNote: ymd_hms() and hour() are from lubridate package and weekdays() is a base R function.\nStep 2: Deriving the attacks tibble data frame\n\nwkday_levels <- c('Saturday', 'Friday', \n                  'Thursday', 'Wednesday', \n                  'Tuesday', 'Monday', \n                  'Sunday')\n\nattacks <- attacks %>%\n  group_by(tz) %>%\n  do(make_hr_wkday(.$timestamp, \n                   .$source_country, \n                   .$tz)) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  mutate(wkday = factor(\n    wkday, levels = wkday_levels),\n    hour  = factor(\n      hour, levels = 0:23))\n\nNote: Beside extracting the necessary data into attacks data frame, mutate() of dplyr package is used to convert wkday and hour fields into factor so they’ll be ordered when plotting\nTable below shows the tidy tibble table after processing.\n\nkable(head(attacks))\n\n\n\n\ntz\nsource_country\nwkday\nhour\n\n\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nBG\nSaturday\n20\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nTW\nSunday\n6\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nTW\nSunday\n8\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nCN\nSunday\n11\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nUS\nSunday\n15\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nCA\nMonday\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the Calendar Heatmaps\n\ngrouped <- attacks %>% \n  count(wkday, hour) %>% \n  ungroup() %>%\n  na.omit()\n\nggplot(grouped, \n       aes(hour, \n           wkday, \n           fill = n)) + \ngeom_tile(color = \"white\", \n          size = 0.1) + \ntheme_tufte(base_family = \"Helvetica\") + \ncoord_equal() +\nscale_fill_gradient(name = \"# of attacks\",\n                    low = \"sky blue\", \n                    high = \"dark blue\") +\nlabs(x = NULL, \n     y = NULL, \n     title = \"Attacks by weekday and time of day\") +\ntheme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n      legend.title = element_text(size = 8),\n      legend.text = element_text(size = 6) )\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk: - a tibble data table called grouped is derived by aggregating the attack by wkday and hour fields. - a new field called n is derived by using group_by() and count() functions. - na.omit() is used to exclude missing value. - geom_tile() is used to plot tiles (grids) at each x and y position. color and size arguments are used to specify the border color and line size of the tiles. - theme_tufte() of ggthemes package is used to remove unnecessary chart junk. To learn which visual components of default ggplot2 have been excluded, you are encouraged to comment out this line to examine the default plot. - coord_equal() is used to ensure the plot will have an aspect ratio of 1:1. - scale_fill_gradient() function is used to creates a two colour gradient (low-high).\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we can simply group the count by hour and wkday and plot it, since we know that we have values for every combination there’s no need to further preprocess the data.\n\n\nBuilding Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nChallenge: Building multiple heatmaps for the top four countries with the highest number of attacks.\n\n\n\nPlotting Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nStep 1: Deriving attack by country object\nIn order to identify the top 4 countries with the highest number of attacks, you are required to do the followings:\n\ncount the number of attacks by country,\ncalculate the percent of attackes by country, and\nsave the results in a tibble data frame.\n\n\nattacks_by_country <- count(\n  attacks, source_country) %>%\n  mutate(percent = percent(n/sum(n))) %>%\n  arrange(desc(n))\n\nStep 2: Preparing the tidy data frame\nIn this step, you are required to extract the attack records of the top 4 countries from attacks data frame and save the data in a new tibble data frame (i.e. top4_attacks).\n\ntop4 <- attacks_by_country$source_country[1:4]\ntop4_attacks <- attacks %>%\n  filter(source_country %in% top4) %>%\n  count(source_country, wkday, hour) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(source_country = factor(\n    source_country, levels = top4)) %>%\n  na.omit()\n\n\n\nPlotting Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nStep 3: Plotting the Multiple Calender Heatmap by using ggplot2 package.\n\nggplot(top4_attacks, \n       aes(hour, \n           wkday, \n           fill = n)) + \n  geom_tile(color = \"white\", \n          size = 0.1) + \n  theme_tufte(base_family = \"Helvetica\") + \n  coord_equal() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(name = \"# of attacks\",\n                    low = \"sky blue\", \n                    high = \"dark blue\") +\n  facet_wrap(~source_country, ncol = 2) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, \n     title = \"Attacks on top 4 countries by weekday and time of day\") +\n  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 8),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 6) )"

    "text": "1. The task\nAge-sex pyramid is an analytical visualization commonly used by demographers to reveal the structure of population by gender and age group. In this take-home exercise, you are required to reveal the demographic structure of Singapore at planning area level by using age-sex pyramid method. Instead of plotting a single age-sex pyramid, however, you are required to display nine selected planning areas on a single view by using trellis display (also know as small-multiple plot).\n\n\n2. Data\n“Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022” is used to prepare the analytical visualization. It is available at Department of Statistics, Singapore(SingStat).\n\nMetadata\nPA = Planning Area\nSZ = Subzone\nAG = Age Group\nSex = Sex\nTOD = Type of Dwelling\nPop = Resident Count\nTime = Time / Period\nNote:\n\nFor June 2022, Planning Areas refer to areas demarcated in the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s Master Plan 2019.\nData from 2003 onwards exclude residents who have been away from Singapore for a continuous period of 12 months or longer as at the reference period.\nThe figures have been rounded to the nearest 10. 4) The data may not add up due to rounding.\n\nDate generated: 29/02/2022 Source: Singapore Department of Statistics\n\n\n\n3. Analysis\n\nWhat is the distribution of Singapore residence by Planning Area?\n\nThe above bar chart depicts the number of residents in each Planning Area. In this scenario, we choose the 9 most populous areas, which account for 52.3% of the overall population.\nNow, let’s examine the demographic specifics of these nine regions. What is the age and gender distribution of the population in each area? We will utilize the pyramid chart, which is separated into equal-height horizontal divisions. The width of each part varies. Population pyramids are produced using a horizontal column chart with positive and negative values. These graphs permit comparisons of distinct categories (in this case, age) across two series (male and female).\nIn addition, for comparative purposes, we introduce Trellis plot techniques, which consist of a grid of smaller plots. Each small plot represents a unique state or item, and all small plots have identical scales.\n\n\nWhat is the demographic breakdown of Singaporeans in the top 9 most populous Planning Areas?\n\n\n\nDesign 1 : 3x3 Trellis plot\n\n\nAt first glance, the shapes of all 9 selected areas are symmetrical. This reflects the proportional distribution of males and females. However, there are a variety of shapes. Bedok, Jurong West, and Hougang have a similar shape, with a symmetrical small apex that gradually widens and tapers to a smaller base. These 3 regions contain a substantial proportion of residents between the ages of 40-69. While Sengkang and Punggol have a form that widens in the 30-59-year age range, the population in the 20-29-year age group is much smaller.\nThis graph also reveals that the senior female population tends to be slightly more than the senior male population.\n\n\n\nDesign 2 : 1x9 Trellis plot\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Visualization Design Discussion\nFrom the Trellis plot above\n\nBedok, which is the most populous area has a big percentage of Senior generation (60 and above) compare to the other area\n\n\n\n5. Step-by-Step Description\n\n1. Prepare the data\nIn this project, we prepare the data using Tableau Prep Builder version 2022.4.0, which makes data preparation simple and intuitive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\nStep\n\n\n\n\n1.1\n\n\nOpen Tableau Prep Builder\nClick the blue button “Connect to Data”\nWe are using csv file, therefore pick “Text file”\nConnect our main data file “respopagesextod2022.csv”\nThe data field summary will be displayed as indicated in the image.

    "text": "1. The task\nAge-sex pyramid is an analytical visualization commonly used by demographers to reveal the structure of population by gender and age group. In this take-home exercise, you are required to reveal the demographic structure of Singapore at planning area level by using age-sex pyramid method. Instead of plotting a single age-sex pyramid, however, you are required to display nine selected planning areas on a single view by using trellis display (also know as small-multiple plot).\n\n\n2. Data\n“Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022” is used to prepare the analytical visualization. It is available at Department of Statistics, Singapore(SingStat).\n\nMetadata\nPA = Planning Area\nSZ = Subzone\nAG = Age Group\nSex = Sex\nTOD = Type of Dwelling\nPop = Resident Count\nTime = Time / Period\nNote:\n\nFor June 2022, Planning Areas refer to areas demarcated in the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s Master Plan 2019.\nData from 2003 onwards exclude residents who have been away from Singapore for a continuous period of 12 months or longer as at the reference period.\nThe figures have been rounded to the nearest 10. 4) The data may not add up due to rounding.\n\nDate generated: 29/02/2022 Source: Singapore Department of Statistics\n\n\n\n3. Analysis\n\nWhat is the distribution of Singapore residence by Planning Area?\n\nThe above bar chart depicts the number of residents in each Planning Area. In this scenario, we choose the 9 most populous areas, which account for 52.3% of the overall population.\nNow, let’s examine the demographic specifics of these nine regions. What is the age and gender distribution of the population in each area? We will utilize the pyramid chart, which is separated into equal-height horizontal divisions. The width of each part varies. Population pyramids are produced using a horizontal column chart with positive and negative values. These graphs permit comparisons of distinct categories (in this case, age) across two series (male and female).\nIn addition, for comparative purposes, we introduce Trellis plot techniques, which consist of a grid of smaller plots. Each small plot represents a unique state or item, and all small plots have identical scales.\n\n\nWhat is the demographic breakdown of Singaporeans in the top 9 most populous Planning Areas?\n\n\n\nDesign 1 : 3x3 Trellis plot\n\n\nAt first look, each of the 9 selected areas appears to have a symmetrical shape. This indicates the ratio of males to females in the population. However, a closer examination reveals that the senior female population is typically slightly larger than the senior male population.\nWe may categorize them into 4 groups based on their similarities.\n\nThe first group comprises two areas, namely Bedok and Jurong West. They have a similar shape, with symmetrical small apex that gradually widens and tapers to a smaller base. These 2 regions contain a substantial proportion of residents between the ages of 40-69.\nWhile the next group Sengkang and Punggol have a form that widens in the 30-39 and 40-49 year age-range, the population in the 20-29-year age group is much smaller.\nThe following group includes 4 areas: Tampines, Woodlands, Hougang, and Choa Chu Kang. This group depicts a little head that rapidly enlarges between the ages of 60 - 69, narrows between the ages of 40-49, and then enlarges again before narrowing at the bottom.\nThe final one is Yishun, which has a unique shape compared to the others. In Yishun, the proportions of the people in the age groups 40-49, 50-59, and 60-69 are very similar, while the 30-39 age group is the greatest.\n\n\n\n\n4. Step-by-Step Description\n\n1. Prepare the data\nIn this project, we prepare the data using Tableau Prep Builder version 2022.4.0, which makes data preparation simple and intuitive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\nStep\n\n\n\n\n1.1\n\n\nOpen Tableau Prep Builder\nClick the blue button “Connect to Data”\nWe are using csv file, therefore pick “Text file”\nConnect our main data file “respopagesextod2022.csv”\nThe data field summary will be displayed as indicated in the image. We can see from this that our original data had 7 fields.\n\n\n\n1.2\n\n\nAdd a clean step by clicking the “+ symbol” and then selecting “Clean Step”\nTo eliminate Planning areas with no population, remove the zero value from the “Pop” parameter\nRename the step as “Filter Pop”\n\n\n\n1.3\n\n\nAdd a clean step “Group age range”\nTo make analysis easier, group the age range into 10 years\n\n\n\n1.4\n\n\nAdd a clean step “Create parameter”\nCreate the fields “Female Population” and “Male Population” using the following formula\n\nIF [Sex]=‘Females’ THEN [Pop] ELSE 0 END\nIF [SEX] = ‘Males’ THEN [Pop] ELSE 0 END\n\nRemove any unneeded fields, including Sex, SZ, TOD, and Time\nAt this point, you should get data with 5 fields 31K rows\n\n\n\n1.5\n\n\nExport the cleansed data to Tableau Desktop with a right-click and the “Preview in Tableau Desktop” option\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Prepare the visualization\nNow that we have import the cleansed data into Tableau Desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\nStep\n\n\n\n\n2.1\n\n\nWe begin by creating the “Total columns” parameter. In our scenario, we wish to generate 3x3 tables with a value of 3 for each column.\n\n\n\n2.2\n\n\nCreate the Calculated Field “Index”, “Column”, and “Row” with the following formula\nIndex = INT((INDEX())%[Total columns]^2+1\nColumn = INT(([Index]-1)%[Total columns])+1\nRow = INT(([Index]-[Column])/[Total columns])+1\n\n\n\n2.3\n\n\nDrag the “Column” Calculated Field into the Columns section. Drag the Row calculated field into the Rows section\nMake sure that the Column and Row are set as Discrete type\n\n\n\n2.4\n\n\nCreate the Trellis plot of 3x3 age-sex pyramid according to the Planning Area by setting the fields as depicted in the image\nStart by dragging the PA field into Filters and then selecting the focus area (top 9 populous)\nThe drag Index followed by PA into the marks\nDrag the fields Male Pop and Female Pop into the Columns pane, while AG is dragged into the Rows window\n\n\n\n2.5\n\n\nConfigure the Column pill to be computed using PA and repeat for Row\n\n\n\n2.6\n\n\nSet the Male Pop axis to be reversed\n\n\n\n2.7\n\n\nSet the color for Male Pop and Female Pop to be different so the spectator may easily distinguish gender\n\n\n\n2.8\n\n\nSort the age range so that 0-9 is at the bottom and 90 and above is at the top\n\n\n\n2.9\n\n\nHide header of Column and Row\n\n\n\n2.10\n\n\nEdit the SUM([Male Pop]) and SUM([Female Pop]) formulas as follows to display the percentage of each gender in each age group for each Planning Area\nSUM([Male Pop]) = SUM([Male Pop]) / (TOTAL(SUM([Male Pop])) + TOTAL(SUM([Female Pop])))\nSUM([Female Pop]) = SUM([Female Pop]) / (TOTAL(SUM([Male Pop])) + TOTAL(SUM([Female Pop])))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.

Critique on Original Design\nAge-sex pyramid is an analytical visualization commonly used by demographers to reveal the structure of population by gender and age group. In addition, the Trellis plot style is employed to facilitate comparisons between planning areas.\nBelow is the original design of the plot that will be redesigned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClarity\nWhen developing a plot, we should have a particular message or insights to communicate to the audience. In our scenario, possible inferences from the trellis age-sex pyramid are as follows:\n\nThe pyramidal structure that represents the distribution of each gender within each age group in each planning area\nThe varied distribution across each region\n\nIn this section, we will evaluate the original plot based on how effectively it conveyed the above inferences to the audience.\n\n(a) Data Selection\nInstead of presenting the entire data set to the viewer, we might pick sample subsets of data that are appropriate for the intended message. By mapping all planning regions, it is extremely difficult for the viewer to compare areas of interest.\n\n\n(b) Graph Title\nInstead of the conventional title, an interesting insight from the graph could be used as as the main title for the chart, as it encourages curiosity among readers to dig deeper into it. The original title lacks both clarity and appeal.\n\n\n(c) Plot arrangement\nThe primary benefit of Trellis plot is that it facilitates comparison. The initial layout placed each plot on the diagonal, making comparison very difficult for the observer. It also restricts the number of plots that may be seen at once.\n\n\n(d) Y-Axis labeling\nThe initial axis represented age range by a single integer. This makes it unclear to the observer whether the displayed value represents the age or the upper or lower bound. Additionally, the Null group is not a representative designation.\n\n\n(e) x-Axis not able to see\nDue to the size of the plot, the x-Axis label cannot be seen unless the viewer scrolls all the way down. Not only is the bar size unclear, but the gender is also difficult to determine.\n\n\n(f) Color representation\nColor is very crucial in visualizing. However, the original plot does not make advantage of it, making it more difficult for viewers to identify gender.\n\n\n(f) Data Label\nThe planning area label is plotted on the axis rather than within the plot, making it difficult for the observer to identify the planning area to which the plot belongs.\n\n\n(g) Resolution settings\nThe resolution is not adjustable. In a smaller screen, the axis is not visible.\n\n\n\n\n4. Proposed Sketch\n\n\n\n5. Step to create plot in R\n\n1. Installing and loading the required libraries\nThe code chunk below is used to install and load the required packages onto RStudio.\n\ntidyverse : A collection of core packages designed for data science, used extensively for data preparation and wrangling.\nplotly: Used for creating interactive web-based graphs.\nggplot2: A system for ‘declaratively’ creating graphics, based on “The Grammar of Graphics”.\n\n\npackages = c('tidyverse', 'plotly', 'ggplot2')\nfor(p in packages){\n  if(!require(p,character.only = T)){\n    install.packages(p)\n  }\n  library(p,character.only = T)\n}\n\n\n\n2.

The task\nIn this take-home exercise, you are required to uncover the salient patterns of the resale prices of public housing property by residential towns and estates in Singapore by using appropriate analytical visualisation techniques learned in Lesson 4: Fundamentals of Visual Analytics. Students are encouraged to apply appropriate interactive techniques to enhance user and data discovery experiences.\nFor the purpose of this study, the focus should be on 3-ROOM, 4-ROOM and 5-ROOM types. You can choose to focus on either one housing type or multiple housing types. The study period should be on 2022.\nThe write-up of the take-home exercise should include but not limited to the followings:\n\nDescribe the selection and designed consideration of the analytical data visualisation used. The discussion should limit to not more than 150 words each.\nA reproducible description of the procedures used to prepare the analytical visualisation. Please refer to the peer submission I shared.\nA write-up of not more than 100 words to discuss the patterns reveal by each analytical visualisation prepared.\n\n\n\n2. Packages\nThe code chunk below is used to install and load the required packages onto RStudio.\n\ntidyverse: A collection of core packages designed for data science, used extensively for data preparation and wrangling. (readr, ggplot2, dplyr, purrr, tidyr, tibble)\npsych: A general purpose toolbox for personality, psychometric theory and experimental psychology. Functions are primarily for multivariate analysis and scale construction using factor analysis, principal component analysis, cluster analysis and reliability analysis, although others provide basic descriptive statistics.\nlubridate: Provides tools that make it easier to parse and manipulate dates. These tools are grouped below by common purpose.\nggrepel: This package contains extra geoms for ggplot2.\n\n\npackages = c('tidyverse', 'ggstatsplot', 'psych', 'lubridate', 'ggrepel', 'plotly')\nfor(p in packages){\n  if(!require(p,character.only = T)){\n    install.packages(p)\n  }\n  library(p,character.only = T)\n}\n\n\n\n3. Data\nThe original dataset ’Resale flat princes based on registration date from Jan-2017 onwards’ was obtained from Data.gov.sg. This dataset provides information on all resale HDB flat transactions from 2017 to 2023. The notable features in this dataset are as follows:\ni) town: the town of the associated HDB flat\nii) flat_type: the type of flat of the associated HDB flat. In Singapore, there are 1-room flats up to 5-room flats, as well as executive flats, which are slightly bigger than 5-room flats. (The remaining flat type: Multi-generational flats, are few and far between)\niii) block: the block of the associated HDB flat\niv) street: the street of the associated HDB flat\nv) storey_range: the storey range of the associated HDB flat. In this dataset, the storey range is given in a range of 3 (e.g. 10 to 12 , which means the flat is based on the 10th to 12th storey).\nvi) floor_area_sqm: the floor area of the associated HDB flat in square meter.\nvii) lease_commence_date: The month and year from when the lease (i.e., 99-year lease, 999-year lease, or freehold) on the property starts.\nvii) remaining_lease: the remaining lease of the associated HDB flat in months and years\nviii) resale_price: the resale price of the assocaited HDB flat\n\nData Preparation\nThe source file is in csv format, hence read_csv of readr package is used to import the dataset. Then we use summary function to see the statistical summary of our original data set. From te result below, we will see that our original data has 146,215 rows with 11 columns ( 8 categorical fields and 3 numeric fields).\n\n\nCode\n# Read data \ndata_raw <-

Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization\nUsing the describe() function on the continuous variables, you can get a sense-check of the data and see if there were any errors in the feature engineering. These are the summary statistics that were observed:\n\nResale Price — The prices of the flats range between $200K to $1,418K with a mean of $536K\nFloor Area — The sizes of the flats range between 51sqm to 159sqm, with a mean of 94.07sqm\nRemaining Lease — The lease commence date of the flats range between 43 years to 96 years\n\n\n\nCode\nknitr:: kable(\n  data_2022 %>% \n    select(floor_area_sqm, remaining_lease, resale_price) %>%\n    na.omit() %>% \n    describe()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvars\nn\nmean\nsd\nmedian\ntrimmed\nmad\nmin\nmax\nrange\nskew\nkurtosis\nse\n\n\n\n\nfloor_area_sqm\n1\n24374\n94.07497\n19.32042\n93\n93.98708\n25.2042\n51\n159\n108\n-0.0566164\n-0.8508218\n0.1237523\n\n\nremaining_lease*\n2\n24374\n376.28600\n180.21525\n377\n380.98656\n247.5942\n1\n638\n637\n-0.0378131\n-1.3214875\n1.1543251\n\n\nresale_price\n3\n24374\n536391.16792\n157993.72136\n515000\n520461.65003\n133434.0000\n200000\n1418000\n1218000\n1.0935155\n1.8129983\n1011.9904756\n\n\n\n\n\nAs graphical summaries can reveal issues that are not obvious from numerical statistics, we will use visualization approaches to convey the underlying insights in this project.\n\nComparison of resale price per sqm among different types of flats\nWe would like to compare price per sqm among 3 types of flat i.e. 3-ROOM, 4-ROOM, and 5-ROOM. To confirm the validity of the hypothesis that the average resale price per sqm are the same among 3 flat types, we the following null hypothesis will be tested.\nH0: The average resale price per sqm among 3 flat types are the same\nH1: The average resale price per sqm among 3 flat types are different\nTo begin the confirmatory data analysis, we would like to test the normality assumption for the distribution of the average resale price per sqm for each type of flat. We use a ridge plot to visualize the distribution of three distinct types simultaneously. All three categories have a right-skewed distribution in the outcome plot.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggstatsplot)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggridges)\n\ndist <- data_2022 %>%\n  group_by(flat_type) %>%\n  mutate(price_per_sqm = resale_price/floor_area_sqm)\n\nggplot(dist, aes(x=price_per_sqm, y=flat_type)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(fill = \"steelblue\", alpha = 0.5)+\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Price per sqm\", \n       x = \"Price per sqm\", \n       y = \"Flat Type\")+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nNevertheless, visual examination alone is insufficient. A significance test comparing the sample distribution to a normal distribution can be used to determine whether or not data exhibit a significant deviation from normality. Therefore, Shapiro-test Wilk’s method is chosen for the normality test confirmation. Shapiro-test Wilk’s test statistics suggest that there is enough statistically evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the distribution of price per sqm are normally distributed. Therefore, we will use non-parametric test to prove our hypothesis.\n\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  sample(dist$price_per_sqm, 5000)\nW = 0.84267, p-value < 2.2e-16\n\n\nThe following packages are required for this visualization\n\nggstatplot: an extension of ggplot2 package for creating graphics with details from statistical tests included in the plots themselves and targeted primarily at behavioral sciences community to provide a one-line code to produce information-rich plots.\n\nAs we are comparing between more than 2 groups, ANOVA is automatically selected by the function. As the p-value for each pair is less than the 0.05 threshold, there is sufficient statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, we may conclude that the average resale price per sqm for three distinct types of apartments are different.\n\nggbetweenstats(dist,\n               x = \"flat_type\",\n               y = \"price_per_sqm\",\n               type = 'np'\n               ) +\n  ggtitle(\"Comparison of resale price per sqm among different types of flats\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignificant Test of Correlation between resale price and floor area\nScatterplots illustrate the relationship between two numerical variables. Each dot stands for an observation. The position of the two variables along the X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) axes represents their respective values. In this scenario, we evaluate the relationship between price and floor area using a scatter plot.We complement the scatter points with the linear model of a straight line. The various angles of the line reflect the various relationships between price and area in each town. This figure also shows that the relationship in some towns, such as CENTRAL AREA, might not seems linear, although it is linear in others, such as BUKIT TIMAH.\n\n\nCode\ng <- ggscatterstats(\n  data = data_2022,\n  x = floor_area_sqm,\n  y = resale_price,\n  marginal = FALSE,\n  point.args = list(size = 0.5, stroke = 0, color = \"steelblue\"),\n  smooth.line.args = list(linewidth = 0.5, color = \"grey\", method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ x)) +  facet_wrap (~ town, nrow = 6, ncol = 6) +\n  xlab(\"floor area\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,3000,6000,9000,12000), name = \"Resale price\") +\n  labs(title = \"Correlation between resale price and floor area\") \n\nggplotly(g)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking for normality and linearity\nBefore drawing conclusions, plotting the correlations will allow us to confirm that they are linear. Here is some code to determine if our data is normally distributed or bell-shaped.\nThe result demonstrates that our data are not normally distributed, as the p-value of the Shapiro-Wilk test is less than 0.05. The scatter falls outside the shaded area, reflecting the same conclusion as the Shapiro-Wilk test. The shaded gray area in the plot represents the quantile confidence bands at 95%. A pattern of observed quantiles in which some points fall outside of these borders suggests an out-of-the-ordinary sample if drawn from a Normal distribution.\n\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nggqqplot(data_2022$floor_area_sqm)\nggqqplot(data_2022$resale_price_kSGD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  sample(data_2022$floor_area_sqm, 5000)\nW = 0.96412, p-value < 2.2e-16\n\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  sample(data_2022$resale_price_kSGD, 5000)\nW = 0.93758, p-value < 2.2e-16\n\n\n\nSince our data are not normally distributed, we will use a Spearman correlation that is non-parametric. In addition, we detected some outliers (>3), hence we will employ the Robust correlation technique to decrease the influence of outliers.\n\n\nCode\nggscatterstats(data = data_2022 |> filter(town == \"CENTRAL AREA\"), \n                           x = floor_area_sqm, y = resale_price_kSGD,\n                           type = \"robust\") + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1)) +\n  labs(title = \"CENTRAL AREA\", \n       x = \"floor area (sqm)\", y = \"resale price(kSGD)\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(50, 150)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1500)) \nggscatterstats(data = data_2022 |> filter(town == \"CHOA CHU KANG\"), \n                           x = floor_area_sqm, y = resale_price_kSGD,\n                           type = \"robust\") + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1)) +\n  labs(title = \"CHOA CHU KANG\", \n       x = \"floor area (sqm)\", y = \"resale price(kSGD)\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(50, 150)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1500))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nour very low P-value shows a very strong evidence against the null hypothesis, that there is no correlation between our variables, in favor of the alternative hypothesis, that floor area and resale price are correlated for both town selected.\nThe presence of a positive winsorised correlation coefficient value in both CENTRAL AREA and CHOA CHU KANG indicates that increasing the floor area (sqm) of flats raises the resale price. In other words,the larger the floor area, the higher the price of the flat.\nThe correlation coefficient indicates the effect size and ranges from -1 to 1. CENTRAL AREA has a correlation value of 0.83, which is higher than CHOA CHU KANG’s correlation coefficient of 0.52, indicating a stronger correlation between the floor area and price in CENTRAL AREA.\n\n\n\nPrices shifted in 2022 for different flat types\nWe display a quarterly boxplot to illustrate the price trend over time for different types of flats. There are numerous outliers with extremely high resale prices in 3, 4, and 5 ROOM.\n\n\nCode\ndata_2022 %>%\n  group_by(flat_type) %>%\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = flat_type, y = resale_price_kSGD)) +\n  # Make grouped boxplot\n  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = as.factor(quarter)), color = \"grey\") +\n    stat_summary(fun=mean, geom=\"point\", color=\"red\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"C\") +\n  # Adjust lables and add title\n  labs(title = \"Resale prices in 2022 by quarter\", y=\"Resale price (kSGD)\", x=\"\", fill = \"Quarter\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWe utilize Wilcoxon rank sum test to confirm our hypothesis that there is a pricing difference between Quarter 1 and Quarter 4. Nonparametric Friedman test is selected as residuals are not-normally distributed.\nIn Wilcoxon rank sum test, medians are only used to better describe not-normally distributed data, but medians are not used to compare groups. In fact the difference in ranks can be significant even when medians are identical.\n\n\nCode\n# 3 ROOM\nthree <- data_2022 %>% \n  filter(quarter %in% c(\"1\", \"4\")) %>% \n  filter(flat_type == \"3 ROOM\")\n  \nggbetweenstats(three,\n               x = \"quarter\",\n               y = \"resale_price_kSGD\",\n               type = 'np'\n               ) +\n  ggtitle(\"3 ROOM\")\n# 4 ROOM\nfour <- data_2022 %>% \n  filter(quarter %in% c(\"1\", \"4\")) %>% \n  filter(flat_type == \"4 ROOM\")\n  \n  \nggbetweenstats(four,\n               x = \"quarter\",\n               y = \"resale_price_kSGD\",\n               type = 'np'\n               ) +\n  ggtitle(\"4 ROOM\")\n# 5 ROOM\nfive <- data_2022 %>% \n  filter(quarter %in% c(\"1\", \"4\")) %>% \n  filter(flat_type == \"5 ROOM\")\n  \n  \nggbetweenstats(five,\n               x = \"quarter\",\n               y = \"resale_price_kSGD\",\n               type = 'np'\n               ) +\n  ggtitle(\"5 ROOM\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nour very low P-value shows a very strong evidence against the null hypothesis (H0), in favor of the alternative hypothesis (HAlt), that sample-medians are different. That tells us that the price in Q4 is significantly increased from Q1.\nP-value only tells that there is an effect from training, but not how strong this effect is. {ggwithinstats} provides the measure of the Effect Size for Repeated Measures ANOVA, which shows that training effect of -0.21 and -0.22.\nThe Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction testing the difference in ranks between price and area. The result suggests that the effects are negative, statistically significant.\n\n\n\nFlat type transaction proportion\nWe’re curious about the proportion of transacted flat types in each area. As a result, a stacked bar graph is used, in which the length or height of each bar is proportionally equivalent to the data that it depicts. This type of chart has the flaw of representing bar height in relative terms, which does not reflect the actual quantity. However, it has the advantage of making proportion visualization easier for small groups e.g. Bukit Timah. The stacked bar chart below shows a relatively low number of 3-ROOM type transactions in PUNGGOL and a high proportion of 5-ROOM type transactions in PASIR RIS.\n\n# Proportional stacked bar chart\nggplot(data_2022, aes(y=town, fill=flat_type)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"E\") +\n  labs(title = \"Flat type transaction proportion\", fill = \"Flat type\",\n       x = \"\", y = \"\")\n# Stacked bar chart\nggplot(data_2022, aes(y=town, fill = flat_type))+\n  geom_bar()+\n    scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"E\") +\n  labs(title = \"Flat type transaction\", fill = \"Flat type\",\n       x = \"\", y = \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will utilize ggbarstats function which provide us the statistic result.\n\nggbarstats(\n  data             = data_2022,\n  x                = flat_type,\n  y                = town,\n  title            = \"Flat type transaction proportion\",\n  xlab             = \"\",\n\n  ggplot.component = list(ggplot2::scale_x_discrete(guide = ggplot2::guide_axis(n.dodge = 2))),\n  palette          = \"Set3\",\n  coord.flip   = TRUE\n)  + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 90))\n\n\n\n\nggbarstats function goes one step further and displays percentages of flat type inside of every town as stacked-bars, where counts are identical to the previous plot, but every town category as one 100 percent.\n\n\nTrend of Singapore Resale flat prices in 2022\nThe geofacet package was chosen to provide a high-level data visualization based on their location. Price trends for each room type are depicted by town using multiple line plots of varying colors to identify each room type. The geofacet maps, which plot based on its geographical position, make it easier to compare areas nearby.\nThe geofacet package requireds a grid file that will be used to assign row and column positions to each area. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that the name in the grid file corresponds to the name of our data area.\nThe following packages are required for plotting geofacet.\n\ngeofacet: The geofacet R package provides a way to flexibly visualize data for different geographical regions by providing a ggplot2 faceting function facet_geo() which works just like ggplot2’s built-in faceting, except that the resulting arrangement of panels follows a grid that mimics the original geographic topology as closely as possible.\n\nTo generate a geofacet plot, we first import our data and Singapore’s grid table. The case of the grid area names is changed to uppercase. In our data, KALLANG is referred to as KALLANG/WHAMPOA, whereas the grid refers to CENTRAL AREA as DOWNTOWN CORE. After correcting these mismatches, we combine the tables to add the column and row fields to our primary data.\n\n\nCode\n# Import data \ngeofacet <- data_2022\n\n# Recode town name to match with area grid\ngeofacet <- geofacet %>% \n  mutate(town = fct_collapse(town, \"KALLANG\" = \"KALLANG/WHAMPOA\"))\n\n# Import the area grid data.\narea_grid <- read_csv(\"data/areagrid.csv\")\n\n# Recode name to match with geofacet data\narea_grid$name <- toupper(area_grid$name)\n\narea_grid <- area_grid %>% \n  mutate(name = fct_collapse(name, \"CENTRAL AREA\" = \"DOWNTOWN CORE\"))\n\ngeofacet <- geofacet %>%\n  group_by(YM, town, flat_type) %>%\n  summarise(avgprice = mean(resale_price, na.rm = TRUE),\n            medprice = median(resale_price, na.rm = TRUE))%>%\n  ungroup()\n\n# merge table with town name\ngeofacet_price <- inner_join(geofacet, area_grid,\n                      by = c(\"town\" = \"name\"))\n\ncommon_grid <- area_grid[area_grid$name %in% unique(geofacet$town),]\n\n\nThis is how the data used for plotting geofacet look likes.\n\n\n\n\n\nYM\ntown\nflat_type\navgprice\nmedprice\nrow\ncol\ncode\n\n\n\n\n2022-01-01\nANG MO KIO\n3 ROOM\n349068.4\n343888\n3\n8\nAM\n\n\n2022-01-01\nANG MO KIO\n4 ROOM\n491894.3\n457500\n3\n8\nAM\n\n\n2022-01-01\nANG MO KIO\n5 ROOM\n741989.8\n695000\n3\n8\nAM\n\n\n2022-01-01\nBEDOK\n3 ROOM\n347235.2\n338000\n4\n11\nBD\n\n\n2022-01-01\nBEDOK\n4 ROOM\n520911.6\n475000\n4\n11\nBD\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the plot, the resale price trend in the Central area, particularly room types 4-room and 5-room, is much greater than the other locations with a rising trends in Q4. In the first quarter, the average price of a 5-room type swing increased significantly. We observe a low and consistent pricing trend at the country’s border, which is distant from the central region.\n\nlibrary(geofacet)\n\nggplot(geofacet_price, aes(x = YM, y = avgprice)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = as.factor(flat_type))) +\n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%b\") +\n  facet_geo(~ town, grid = common_grid) +\n  labs(title = \"Singapore Resale flat price trends\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(250000, 500000, 750000, 1000000, 1250000)) +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=22),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 45),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n        strip.text = element_text(size = 10),\n        legend.position = \"top\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResale flat type by town\nAs we look for a way to display multiple continuous variables concurrently, the bubble chart is our first choice. The primary purpose of a bubble chart is to illustrate the relationships between numerical variables, and it can represent two to four dimensions. The first two dimensions represent coordinates, while the third represents color and the fourth represents size. In our case, we select 3 variables for this visualization i.e. average price, average housing age, and average floor area.\nggplot2 package is used to create the bubble chart.\n\nggplot2: A system for ‘declaratively’ creating graphics, based on “The Grammar of Graphics”.\n\nAccording to the graph below, the average age of resale apartments in MARINE PARADE is above 45 years, while the average price is in the middle of the price range. CENTRAL AREA has the highest average price, an average age of approximately 30 years, and the smallest average floor area. Whereas, the new flats are located in PUNGGOL, SEMBAWANG, and SENGKANG and have a comparatively large floor area.\n\ndata_2022 %>%\n  group_by(town) %>%\n  # Calculate housing age\n  mutate(housing_age = 2022 - lease_commence_date) %>%\n  summarise(average_price = mean(resale_price_kSGD), average_housing_age = mean(housing_age), average_area = mean(floor_area_sqm)) %>%\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=average_housing_age, y=average_price, size = average_area)) +\n  geom_count(aes(color = average_housing_age), alpha = 0.6) +\n  # Change size of count points\n\n  # Add lables next to count points\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label = town),size = 2.0) +\n  scale_size(range = c(.1, 24), name=\"Average floor area\")+\n  scale_y_continuous( limits = c(400, 800)) +\n  scale_x_continuous( limits = c(0, 50)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\") +\n  scale_color_viridis_c(option = \"C\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrices per area for each storey range\nA heatmap is a graphical representation of data that uses colors to represent the individual values in a matrix. The price per area of each storey range in each town is shown here.This visualization is useful for providing a quick overview, but it is difficult to translate a hue into a specific number. From the plot, we can see that some storey ranges in certain areas cost much higher prices per square foot than other ranges, such as the 4-6 storey range in BUKIT PANJANG.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(hrbrthemes)\n\nheatmap <- data_2022 %>%\n  group_by(flat_type) %>%\n  mutate(price_per_sqm = resale_price/floor_area_sqm)\n\np <-  ggplot(heatmap , aes(town, storey_range, fill= price_per_sqm, text = price_per_sqm)) +\n  scale_fill_distiller(palette = \"RdPu\") +\n  theme_ipsum() + \n  geom_tile() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 1.5, hjust=1))+\n  labs(title = \"Price per area for each storey range\", x=\"\", y=\"\") \n\nggplotly(p, tooltip= \"text\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup Box plot : Resale prices in 2022 by town\n\ndata_2022 %>%\n  group_by(flat_type) %>%\n  # Extract quarter and price per sqm\n  mutate(price_per_sqm = resale_price_kSGD/floor_area_sqm) %>%\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = town, y = price_per_sqm)) +\n  # Make grouped boxplot\n  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = as.factor(flat_type)), color = \"grey\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"C\") +\n  # Adjust lables and add title\n  labs(title = \"HDB resale prices in 2022 by town\", y=\"Price per square metre (SGD)\", fill = \"flat_type\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.
