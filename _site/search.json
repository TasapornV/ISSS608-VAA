In this take-home exercise, you are required to\n\nreveal the demographic structure of Singapore at planning area level by using age-sex pyramid method.\ndisplay nine selected planning areas on a single view by using trellis display (also know as small-multiple plot).\n\nTrellis Charts are used to display multiple charts on one worksheet. They are great to get a quick overview. For example, you could build charts for individual countries, categories, etc.\n\n\n2.
